# BUILT.md

Single source of truth for what actually exists in **this** repo, verified
against code/tests/database — not aspiration, not the old project's status.

**Rule for maintaining this file:** every claim here must be traceable to a
commit, a passing test, or a direct query against the running system.
"Planned" and "built" are never the same bullet. When in doubt, mark it
`[unverified]` rather than assert it. Update this file in the same commit as
the work it describes — it does not get a separate cleanup pass later.

Legend: `[built]` verified working · `[in progress]` partially done ·
`[unverified]` claimed but not personally confirmed this session

## Core platform

- `[built]` **Repository initialised.** `git init` run on `main`, with
  `.gitignore` written first. `reference/`, `venv/`, `.DS_Store`,
  `__pycache__/` and `.pytest_cache/` confirmed excluded via `git check-ignore`.
  *Not yet committed — the first commit is Lyle's.*
- `[built]` **`anam/` package skeleton.** Subpackages `api/`, `api/routes/`,
  `memory/`, `engine/`, `tools/`, `integrity/`, `settings/`, `ops/`,
  `artifacts/` — all empty apart from `api/`.
- `[built]` **Layered configuration** (`anam/config.py`).
  `defaults.toml` → `local.toml` → `ANAM_*` env, deep-merged, read through
  call-time accessors with no module-level constants. Bad values raise
  `ConfigError` rather than silently defaulting. 10 tests, including a live
  proof that `ANAM_API_PORT` changes the port the server actually binds.
- `[built]` **FastAPI application factory** (`anam/api/app.py`) with routers
  split by domain. OpenAPI and docs endpoints disabled.
- `[built]` **Health endpoint** — `GET /api/health` returns `{"status": "ok"}`.
  Liveness only; reports on no dependencies. Verified live, not mocked.
- `[built]` **`run_server.py`** — `--debug` and `--port`, logging to console
  and `logs/anam.log`.
- `[built]` **`start.sh`** — loopback by default, `--lan` binds `0.0.0.0`,
  health-check readiness poll, process-group teardown. Ctrl+C verified to shut
  down gracefully with no orphaned processes and the port released. Known
  cosmetic issue: bash job control prints a `Terminated: 15` notice on a normal
  Ctrl+C (see changelog).

## Eval / observability

- `[built]` **Test suite** — 14 tests passing (`pytest`), `ruff check` clean.
- `[built]` **Store-isolation guard skeleton** (`tests/conftest.py`). Captures
  real paths at import before any test can patch them; `StoreIsolationViolation`
  derives from `BaseException` so `except Exception` blocks cannot swallow it.
  **Not yet armed** against a real store — there is none. Task 1.4 arms it.
