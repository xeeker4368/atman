# BUILT.md

Single source of truth for what actually exists in **this** repo, verified
against code/tests/database — not aspiration, not the old project's status.

**Rule for maintaining this file:** every claim here must be traceable to a
commit, a passing test, or a direct query against the running system.
"Planned" and "built" are never the same bullet. When in doubt, mark it
`[unverified]` rather than assert it. Update this file in the same commit as
the work it describes — it does not get a separate cleanup pass later.

Legend: `[built]` verified working · `[in progress]` partially done ·
`[unverified]` claimed but not personally confirmed this session

## Core platform

- `[built]` **Repository initialised.** `git init` run on `main`, with
  `.gitignore` written first. `reference/`, `venv/`, `.DS_Store`,
  `__pycache__/` and `.pytest_cache/` confirmed excluded via `git check-ignore`.
  *Not yet committed — the first commit is Lyle's.*
- `[built]` **`anam/` package skeleton.** Subpackages `api/`, `api/routes/`,
  `memory/`, `engine/`, `tools/`, `integrity/`, `settings/`, `ops/`,
  `artifacts/` — all empty apart from `api/`.
- `[built]` **Layered configuration** (`anam/config.py`).
  `defaults.toml` → `local.toml` → `ANAM_*` env, deep-merged, read through
  call-time accessors with no module-level constants. Bad values raise
  `ConfigError` rather than silently defaulting. 10 tests, including a live
  proof that `ANAM_API_PORT` changes the port the server actually binds.
- `[built]` **FastAPI application factory** (`anam/api/app.py`) with routers
  split by domain. OpenAPI and docs endpoints disabled.
- `[built]` **Health endpoint** — `GET /api/health` returns `{"status": "ok"}`.
  Liveness only; reports on no dependencies. Verified live, not mocked.
- `[built]` **`run_server.py`** — `--debug` and `--port`, logging to console
  and `logs/anam.log`.
- `[built]` **`start.sh`** — loopback by default, `--lan` binds `0.0.0.0`,
  health-check readiness poll, process-group teardown. Ctrl+C verified to shut
  down gracefully with no orphaned processes and the port released. Known
  cosmetic issue: bash job control prints a `Terminated: 15` notice on a normal
  Ctrl+C (see changelog).

## Memory / retrieval

- `[built]` **Two-database schema.** `archive.db` (append-only, frozen, two
  tables) and `working.db` (operational, 9 tables + FTS5). Defined in
  `anam/memory/schema/*.sql`; narrative in `docs/DB_SCHEMA.md`.
- `[built]` **Atomic dual write** (`anam/memory/db.py`). A message reaches both
  stores in one transaction over an `ATTACH`ed connection, or neither. Proven by
  `test_failed_write_leaves_neither_store_touched`, which forces a failure
  between the two inserts. Both databases pinned to `DELETE` journaling — WAL
  would break cross-database atomicity.
- `[built]` **Canonical `chunks` table** with `NOT NULL` provenance columns.
  ChromaDB and FTS5 are derived from it and rebuildable from it. *No writer yet
  — task 1.3 fills it.*
- `[built]` **FTS5 index** over `chunks.text` as an external-content table, kept
  in sync by insert/delete/update triggers rather than by convention.
- `[built]` **`supersedes` link table** (decision #2) with self-link and
  duplicate-link constraints, plus **cycle guards** — `BEFORE INSERT` and
  `BEFORE UPDATE` triggers using a recursive CTE, rejecting any link that would
  close a loop of any length. Verified against 2-cycles and 4-hop cycles.
  *No classifier yet — task 3.3; task 3.5 must additionally carry a visited set
  at read time, see `docs/DB_SCHEMA.md`.*
- `[built]` **Versioned migration runner** (`anam/memory/migrations.py`).
  Forward-only, transactional, records versions as part of the same transaction.
  `MIGRATIONS` is empty; version 1 is the initial schema. The archive has no
  migration path by design.
- `[built]` **Tables asserted absent**: no review queue, no self-modification
  columns, no summaries, no excluded-chunks (decisions #14, #15, #6, #1).

## Admin / settings

- `[built]` **`settings` table** with a CHECK-constrained `value_type`.
  *No store or cache yet — task 1.11. `anam/settings/` is still empty.*

## Users / households

- `[built]` **`users` table** in both stores, with `role` (`admin` | `user`,
  CHECK-constrained) and `password_hash` in working. Created atomically across
  both stores. *No auth or role gating yet — task 1.12.*

## Eval / observability

- `[built]` **Test suite** — 53 tests passing (`pytest`), `ruff check` clean.
- `[built]` **Store-isolation guard skeleton** (`tests/conftest.py`). Captures
  real paths at import before any test can patch them; `StoreIsolationViolation`
  derives from `BaseException` so `except Exception` blocks cannot swallow it.
  Now exercised: the `isolated_data_dir` fixture redirects the data directory
  per test, and a full suite run creates no `data/` directory in the repo.
  Task 1.4 extends it to the vector store.
