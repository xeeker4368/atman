# NOW.md

Overwritten each session. This is the single place for "where things stand
right now" — current state, the decision log, backlog, and active task.
Do not let a second doc grow up beside this one to track the same thing.

Last updated: [fill in at first real session]

## Current state

Repo scaffolded. `reference/old-anam/` present (reference-only, see
`AGENTS.md`). Canonical docs (this set of five) just written. No code
written yet. Master build plan not yet drafted.

## Active task

None yet — next step is drafting the master build plan from the decision
log below.

## Decision log

Every architectural and scope decision made before code exists. CC should
treat every line here as DECIDED — implement against it, don't relitigate
it. If a task seems to require deviating from one of these, stop and flag
it rather than deciding silently.

1. **Self-description confabulation** — one unified fabrication detector
   covers both tool-output fabrication and identity-claim fabrication (no
   separate detector for the identity-claim case). Retroactive treatment of
   any pre-existing fabricated content is moot — full database wipe applies
   to this build, no exceptions.
2. **Correction / supersession** — when a human corrects the entity,
   detection of "this message corrects that prior claim" is
   **model-judged** (a small classifier call on candidate correction turns),
   not heuristic keyword matching. Requires its own frozen eval case set
   (real corrections + real near-miss non-corrections) before trusting it
   in production, same discipline as the fabrication gate. Linked chunks
   get a `supersedes` relationship; retrieval must respect it.
3. **Research topic seeding** — conversation memory seeds research
   candidates two ways: the entity can self-flag a topic mid-conversation,
   and a periodic background pass mines recent conversations (**including
   Jodie's** — her conversations are legitimate source material even though
   she can't trigger research herself). Both only ever *propose* — they
   land in a human-approved queue, they never execute anything.
4. **Authorization model for research/scheduler actions** — the only
   distinction that matters is **propose vs. execute**, not who/what
   triggered it. Proposing (mining, self-flag, manual note) never requires
   a flag — it's inert until approved. Executing (actual web/Moltbook
   calls, writing the result) always requires the relevant `allow_*` flag —
   **except** when a human is directly driving the action (you ran the
   command, you approved the queued item) — that always just works, no
   flag needed. The flags exist for exactly one case: fully unattended,
   no-human-in-the-loop execution (the nightly scheduler tick).
5. **Sense of time** — the current-timestamp injection every turn is
   already a good pattern (carry forward). New: **explicitly compute and
   state elapsed time** since the user's last message ("It has been 14
   hours since your last message") as a flat, neutral fact. `soul.md` must
   pair this with an explicit instruction that the gap represents no
   experience, no continuity, and nothing to have "felt" or "been thinking
   about" during it — this is a deliberate confabulation-prevention
   pairing, not optional flavor text.
6. **History windowing** — token-budget cutoff for what's resent to the
   model each turn (reserve space for system prompt + retrieved chunks +
   output, give the remainder to the most recent raw history). Nothing is
   deleted or summarized — older turns just stop being resent every time
   and remain retrievable normally. Not fixed-message-count.
7. **Frontend architecture** — hybrid. React (rebuilt with one coordinated
   state machine, not scattered `useState` + competing pollers) for the
   chat interface. Plain server-rendered forms for the admin settings
   panel. Backend stays FastAPI.
8. **Settings persistence** — a settings table in the working DB, in-memory
   cache invalidated on write. No setting requires a restart to take
   effect. Admin-only, loopback-gated — never exposed to Jodie.
9. **Settings UX** — a Save button that appears only once a change has been
   made (uniform across every setting, no special-cased extra confirmation
   for higher-stakes toggles — including turning off approval-required on
   an external action). Any setting representing a connection to an
   external system additionally gets a **Check/Verify button**, generated
   automatically because the setting declares a verification function —
   not hardcoded per-setting. Internal tuning values (temperature,
   thresholds) never get a Check button.
10. **Creative writing space** — new `artifact_type` (e.g.
    `creative_writing`), stored under `workspace/`, same infrastructure as
    research notes/journal entries. **No gate** — lowest risk category,
    fully autonomous, can be triggered by the entity in **any**
    autonomous/background session (periodic mining pass, bounded research
    execution, nightly reflection cycle) as well as in live conversation.
    Indexed into memory/retrieval like everything else, tagged with its
    own `source_type` so it's separable later if it ever competes for
    retrieval slots the way research notes do. **Private by default** —
    not proactively surfaced — but either the entity or a human can
    initiate sharing, and **the entity may refuse to share a piece if it
    wants to.** This is a real, low-stakes first instance of the
    entity-can-decline principle in `PROJECT.md`.
11. **File upload extraction scope** — text files and PDFs get full content
    extraction and indexing. Office documents, OCR, image, audio, video
    stay metadata-only / deferred, as in the prior implementation.
12. **Moltbook posting** — reuses the enabled/approval-required toggle from
    #9, applied to this capability specifically (read-only = disabled;
    draft-only = enabled + approval-required; controlled = enabled, no
    approval). Additionally: a numeric **rate limit** (posts/day) as a
    hard ceiling independent of the approval setting. No artificial delay
    before this becomes available — build the mechanism, Lyle decides when
    to flip it.
13. **iMessage** — deferred entirely for this build (see `PROJECT.md`).
14. **Review queue** — skip for this build. Its only consumer (self-mod) is
    deferred; add it back alongside self-mod when that returns, not before.
15. **Self-modification's future seam** — **no seam.** Build this system
    clean, with no self-mod accommodation baked in anywhere. When self-mod
    returns it gets a full design pass, including the sandboxing/execution
    question the prior implementation never actually resolved. The prior
    2026-05-09 "applied guidance" event is not a validated proof that
    self-modification works — the content was operator-dictated, not
    entity-generated, and whether that counts is explicitly unresolved. Do
    not treat it as a reference implementation to preserve compatibility
    with.
16. **Database wipe** — full wipe before go-live, no partial-preservation
    exception this time. Confirmed explicitly given this build's data is
    disposable test data throughout.
17. **Jodie's permissions** — image generation: yes. Creative writing:
    yes (see #10). Research triggering: no, admin/entity-initiated only —
    but her conversations are still mined for research candidates (#3).
    Settings: never.
18. **Model selection convention** (process, not architecture) — Sonnet is
    the default for all CC tasks. Opus is called out by name only for
    genuinely hard architectural calls: schema design, retrieval
    scoring/RRF weighting, provenance semantics, `soul.md` wording. Every
    task in the master plan should state which model it expects.
19. **Compute tier** — Max plan confirmed. Multi-session, multi-day
    pacing is still realistic given real work volume and review bandwidth,
    but quota itself is not the binding constraint.

## Backlog (deferred, not forgotten)

Self-modification (+ review queue), iMessage (all stages), vision baseline →
self-image → avatar (blocked on camera hardware), Working Theories,
Interpretation Trace Runtime, Temporal Runtime Headers (beyond the
elapsed-time statement), Web Source Runtime, orchestrator/contradiction-
detection agent, public internet exposure.

**Retrieval floor calibration** — floors ship permissive/uncalibrated by
design (see `BUILD_PLAN.md` Phase 1 notes). Once real conversation history
exists in meaningful volume, calibrate actual threshold values and verify
the degenerate-query rule (task 1.6) actually fires on real weak-match
cases — it structurally cannot be exercised while floors are permissive.
Do not let this quietly stay permissive forever by default.

## Go-live checklist (placeholder — fill in once build is underway)

- [ ] Full database wipe executed and verified
- [ ] `soul.md` final wording reviewed
- [ ] Model temperature finalized
- [ ] Go-live reset command tested
- [ ] All eval/probe harnesses passing on final build
